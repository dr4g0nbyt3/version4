Tribe Evolution Simulator

World Class.
	Size Class
		Small, Med, Large,

	Environment Class
		Desert, Mountains, Tundra, Swamp.
		Animals	


Tribe Class.

    I am thinking about having a phase based system to set how the Tribe grows.
	Size Class
		Small, Med, Large,

	Sustainability

	Type
		Hunter, Gatherer.

	Skill Predilection

    Create a base set and allow for hybrid evolutions.
        Ex: Hunter base set takes over gatherer base set becomes Hunter Gatherer Hybrid.



Person Class.
	Skill set
	    highest skill set.
	    second highest skill set.
	    tribe skill set.
	Armor
	    Should this develop over time for the skills they work in or acquire pieces over time that can be used by a smith, leather worker etc.
	Weapon
	

Pet Class.


Neural Net:
    Return a group string or a name string.
    I have a prediction that having a strong blacksmith will make the difference early game.


Running list of ideas:
    How the game will play out:
        tribes created - each with x amount of people
            - with roughly even spread of job/skills (some variance depending on environment and the tribe)
        -people start working to get resources/make advancements
        -people consume resources to live and reproduce
        -once population gets large enough, expand into new sections (pick unoccupied sections first)
        -if no unoccupied sections, go to war - winner gets a section from the loser.
            -winner also keeps some of the buildings/tech/resources the loser had in that section (this is part of the evolution)
            - The trick that is going to be so crucial is to create a society that is specific in it's own way.
        -if a tribe loses their last section, they are eliminated
        -war takes up a lot of resources while it's going on

    Things to develop with resources:
        -buildings - (stone/wood) - allows for higher population
        -science stuff - (general resources and money) - unlock new tech - faster tribe growth
        -food - (hunting/gathering) - allows maintaining/growing a population - food type depends on environment
        -weapons - (wood/stone/metal/tech advancements) - used to win wars
        -trade - if surplus of one resource can trade with other tribe for different resource (have many factors affect the trade value of items)
            -can't trade with a tribe you're at war with
